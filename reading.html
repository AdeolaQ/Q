<h1>READING</h1>
<p>First what is reading, Reading is the process of taking in the sense or meaning of letters, symbols,etc, especially by sight or touch.
</p>
    <br>For educators and researchers, reading is a multifaceted process involving such areas as word recognition, orthography (spelling), alphabetics, phonics, phonemic awareness, vocabulary, comprehensipn, fluency, and motivation. </br>
    <br>Other types of reading and writing, such as pictograms(e.r., a hazard symbol and an emoji), are not based on the speech-based writing systems. The common link is the interpretation of symbols to extract the meaning from the visual notations or tactile signals (as in the case of Braille.)

    <h2>THOR</h2>
    <p>Thor's hammer is missing again. The thunder god has a disturbing habit of misplacing his weapon- the mightest force in the Nine Worlds- but this time the hammer isn't just lost. It has fallen into enemy hands.</p>
    <p>If Magnus Chase and his friends can't retrieve the hammer quickly, the mortal worlds will be defenseless against an onslaught of giants. Ragnarok will begin. The Nine Worlds will burn. Unfortunately, the only person who can broker a deal for the hammer's return is the god's worst enemy, Loki- and the price he wants is very high.</p>

<h2>APOLLO</h2>
<p>How do you punish an immortal?By making him human. After angering his father Zeus, the god Apollo is cast down from Olympus. Weak and disoriented, he lands in New York City as a regular teenage boy. Now, without his godly powers, the four-thousand -year-old deity must learn to survive in the modern world until he can somehow find a way to regain Zeus's favor. But Apollo has many enemies - gods, monsters, and mortals who would love to see the former Olympian permanently destroyed. Apollo need s help, and he can think of only one place to go ...an enclave of modern demigods known as Camp Half-Blood.</p>
